## fish 

Our submission - it's a very minimal game in which you try to control a fish in currents

It's currently playable (on github pages)[https://anniepoo.github.io/]

Use WASD

It's pointless

## blob

A Python/pygame demo of an area constraint on a blob. 
There's some overflow error and I'm bored
with it, so in the spirit of the Low Effort Game Jam, I'm not worrying about it.
